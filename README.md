# Grid Overlay

### Install
Include the [gridOverlay](https://github.com/corysimmons/grid-overlay/blob/master/gridOverlay.js) script in your `.html` file

### Usage
- Anything with the class `.go` will get a full-height, semi-opaque, blue background to help you determine what your grid looks like in context to other grid elements on the page.
- To select all the immediate children of an element, instead of having to specify `.go` on every single one, just add the attribute `go-parent` to the containing element.
